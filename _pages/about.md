About Me
=
I am Harish Kumar Dureppagari, a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>, focusing on advancing localization techniques for 5G and 6G networks, with a particular emphasis on Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). My research primarily revolves around designing robust positioning algorithms, developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks, and conducting thorough performance analyses leveraging information inequalities. 

I have also held summer internship positions at <a href="https://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a>, IL (Summer 2023) and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a>, San Diego, CA (Summer 2024 and Summer 2025). Prior to my Ph.D., I was a Lead Engineer at <a href="https://wisig.com/">WiSig Networks Pvt Ltd</a>, where I contributed to the design of beamforming and scheduling algorithms for 4G/5G Massive MIMO systems and developed a 3GPP-compliant system-level simulator for their validation.
