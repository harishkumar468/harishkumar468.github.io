About Me
=
I am pursuing my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>, focusing on advancing localization techniques for 5G and 6G networks, with a particular emphasis on Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). My research primarily revolves around developing positioning algorithms and conducting thorough performance analyses using information inequalities. I also held two summer internship positions at <a href="https://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a>, IL (Summer 2023) and <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a>, CA (Summer 2024). Before this, I was a Lead Engineer at <a href="https://wisig.com/">WiSig Networks Pvt Ltd</a>, where I worked on the design and validation of beamforming and scheduling algorithms for 4G and 5G Massive MIMO systems.
